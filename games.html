				<td><div class ="td_description"> In F3R0T players should survive as long as they can on an island that is both cursed and blessed by the presence of Kla-Kla, the self-appraised and slightly unstable god. Players start with only a dagger to protect themselves. To survive they should gather resources, make tools and build a base to protect themselves from monsters that emerge at night. The game ends when only one player is still alive. This means that players can also fight each other to become the winner.</div></td>
				<td><div class ="td_description">Dookie Disaster is a multiplayer, PC game, in which players take the role of children. The players have to protect their sandcastles from other kids on the island. As they play dead serious war toddlers, the only appropriate way to defend the castle is by throwing their duty to the other players (hence the title of the game).</div></td>
				<td><div class ="td_description">Krun Krun is a game in which the player has to catch as many masks as he canwith his face, while remaining in balance. In order to do this, the player has to tilt their phone and keep a keen eye on the balance bar. If Krun Krun, the shaman apprentice, falls, then the player loses the game.</div></td>

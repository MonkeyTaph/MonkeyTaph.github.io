				<td><div class ="td_description"> In F3R0T, players have to fight each other in order to win the favor (and endless love) of the Slightly Useless Gods. Fortunately, the island the battle takes place on has some strange mysteries that might help them in their combat. Who knows what weapon they will get from that chest that just fell from the sky? How can part of the island suddenly be on fire? What does that major crator do there? Disclaimer: F3R0T can destroy friendships.</div></td>
				<td><div class ="td_description">Dookie Disaster is a multiplayer, PC game, in which players take the role of children. The players have to protect their sandcastles from other kids on the island. As they play dead serious war toddlers, the only appropriate way to defend the castle is by throwing their duty to the other players (hence the title of the game).</div></td>
				<td><div class ="td_description">Krun Krun is a game in which the player has to catch as many masks as he canwith his face, while remaining in balance. In order to do this, the player has to tilt their phone and keep a keen eye on the balance bar. If Krun Krun, the shaman apprentice, falls, then the player loses the game.</div></td>

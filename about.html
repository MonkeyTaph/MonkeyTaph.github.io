				<div class = "text_column">Goldcrest Games is an indie game studio located in Groningen and was founded by Bas Altenburg, Justin Geschiere and Evalien Wiersma in 2016. Among other reasons, we mainly started the company to create an environment in which we could practice our skills, experiment with new techniques and, of course, make games that both entertain and inspire its players.</div>
				<div class = "text_column" style="padding: 0 5%">Most of our games are meant to be played by friends who like to spend an afternoon joking around in a silly game especially made for them. That's why most of our games involve violently, yet comically, battling your friends in unlikely scenarios. In our eyes, there's no better way to show your love for your friends! </div>
				<div class = "text_column">Although at the moment we think our team is nice and cozy, we think that our game studio should grow. This enables us to offer our players the best experiences within the game and its community.<br><br> If you would like to keep up to date, please follow our social media or join our news letter!</div>

					<h2>Bas Altenburg</h2>
					<h3>3D artist, audio designer</h3>
					<p>My name is Bas Altenburg. I spend most of my free hours trolling my friends in online games. If I'm not doing that, you can probably find me somewhere playing music with my band or enjoying a card game and a beer. Currently I am lead designer and audio director for F3R0T. This means I come up with insidious ways for you to screw over your friends and make a choir cheer you on as you're doing it. </p></div>

					<h2>Justin Geschiere</h2>
					<h3>Programmer, designer</h3>
					<p>The model of instructional design is implemented for systematically determined course contents and delivery methods that follows a logical sequence. Learners activities are predefined and a uniform sequence of instruction is practiced. However, socio-cultural paradigm is focused by utilizing the model of collaborative learning in performing practical tasks and assignments.</p></div>

					<h2>Evalien Wiersma</h2>
					<h3>2D/3D artist, marketing</h3>
					<p>My name is Evalien Wiersma and I am a 2D and 3D artist, amateur author and above-average crochteter. In my spare time, one can also often find me binge-watching movies, reading books and doodling mildly realistic dwarfs. My favourite books are those by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.</p></div>
